## How do you use it?
When you enter chromaticity values to each of color 1 and color 2, and press the top button, the color difference between the two colors is displayed.
The color difference is calculated considering the case of each color sense type.

Each color sense type ......

- C type: normal color sense. 95% of Japanese men are this type. I am also this type.
- P type: L type of cone whose function is weak or not functioning. The difference between red and green is difficult to understand.
- D type: M type in which the cone is weak or not functioning. Like P type, the difference between red and green is difficult to understand, but the combination of colors is slightly different.

## When to use?
 - "Although there is know-how of colorimetry, there is no know-how for color weakness correspondence!"
 - "I would like to correspond to color universal design, but I do not know what color to use!"
 - "I want to tell the color engineering designer how to see the color of the weak color!"
 
You can extract only the conversion script from the contained library to L*a*b*.
